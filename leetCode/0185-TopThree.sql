The Department table holds all departments of the company.
+----+----------+
| Id | Name     |
+----+----------+
| 1  | IT       |

+----+----------+

Write a SQL query to find employees who earn the top three salaries in each of the department. 

For the above tables, your SQL query should return the following rows (order of rows does not matter).
+------------+----------+--------+
| Department | Employee | Salary |
+------------+----------+--------+
| IT         | Max      | 90000  |
| IT         | Randy    | 85000  |
| IT         | Joe      | 85000  |
| IT         | Will     | 70000  |
| Sales      | Henry    | 80000  |
| Sales      | Sam      | 60000  |
+------------+----------+--------+
